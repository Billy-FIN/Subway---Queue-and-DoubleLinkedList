# Subway---Queue-and-DoubleLinkedList
This is a simulation of the Red Line for the MBTA (A subway line in Boston). This will entail populating the stations with trains and passengers from text files, run the simulation, and print out a log that includes the status of the railwayâ€™s stations and the movement of trains and passengers.
